## Useful Tools and Links

#### By [Andar](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?members/andar.11882/), 16 Aug 2015

<br/>
The RPG Maker series is a good tool for creating a game, but even the makers can't do everything. And especially when you plan to make a bigger or more complex game, then you will need tools to help and to organise everything.

Other users already have made lists of programs for certain areas - you can find them on the forum, and I'll link them here later.<br/>
But I'll begin with my own lists of tools I have used or plan to use/test in the future.

<br/>
World/Story building tools:<br/>
[Random Inn/Tavern Generator](http://inkwellideas.com/free-tools/random-inn-generator-floorplan/) (including Menu, Rumors, List of Staff and Patrons, Website)<br/>
[donjon; RPG Tools](http://donjon.bin.sh) (Name, Quest, ... Generation, Website)

<br/>
Data organisation tools<br/>
[Articy:Draft 14-day-Trial](https://www.nevigo.com/en/articydraft/try/) (professional story organisation including simulated storyflow)<br/>
[Treepad: Personal Information Manager, Notes Organizer, Word Processor, PIM, Database and more!](http://www.treepad.com) (Windows and Linux programs)<br/>
